Unity Pathfinding Notes

Steering...
Use Gizmo to see lines drawn of certain object movement
OnDrawGizmos() is a reserved method of unity library
Gizmos.color = Color.red; //Makes line red
Basically detection line

LookAt(target); //Makes gameobject look at target or whatever in parameters

Create a circuit to establish either a circular rotation or a arena barrier


Algorithms
Dijkstra's Algorithm helps with...
- Finding shortest path
- Used in social networking app
- Telephone network
- Find locations in maps

Its time complexity is 0(ElogV)
where E = edges and V = vertices
Space complexity is O(V)

Set initial node and goal node
Gives/returns the least cost path to the goal node
Algorithm used in navigator to find least cost path
Binary heap understanding is required to implement algorithm

BINARY HEAP

Start from Algorithm Dijkstra

A* picks better looking node for next to find shortest pathway between goal and starting node
Better heuristic, quicker/shorter time A* finds a path
Any complicated setup may delay it
Doesn't need to visit all vertices compared to Dikjstra Algorithm
because Dikjstra visits all nodes before finding shortest algorithm

The process for Dikjstra is similar to A*
It starts from vertex 0
List all other vertices from start to infinity
Repeats process of...
Visiting unvisited vertex with smallest known distnace from start
Calculate
Repeat until all vertices are visited
